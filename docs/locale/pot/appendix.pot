These releases aren't as mature as bugfix release, but are considered stable and useable. Though these releases try to be backward compatible, features are added, unused code removed, and overall improvements are made, so plugins and themes might need to be updated to make use of the new and improved features."

The core team makes these releases available to get some real-world testing and feedback on the release. That said, the API in release candidates is considered stable, so once a release candidate is made available, you should feel comfortable writing plugins against any new APIs."
